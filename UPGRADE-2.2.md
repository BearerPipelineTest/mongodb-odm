# UPGRADE FROM 2.1 to 2.2

## Aggregation

The new `Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Aggregation\Builder::getAggregation()` method
returns an `Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Aggregation\Aggregation` instance, comparable
to the `Query` class.

The `Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Aggregation\Builder::execute()` method was deprecated
and will be removed in ODM 3.0.
